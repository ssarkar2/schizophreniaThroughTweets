TweeboParser's Python wrapper
============================

This a Python wrapper for the TweeboParser of the CMU ARK's lab:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/TweetNLP/#tweeboparser_tweebank

For usage, please see 'test.py' (you have to first define a environment variable 'TWEET_DEP_PARSER',
which points to the TweeboParser's main directory). Contact me at nguyenxuankhanhm@gmail.com for suggestions.

This wrapper is adapted from the 'ark-tweet-nlp-python' project of Ian Ozsvald:
