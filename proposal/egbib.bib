abstract     = {<p>Major depression constitutes a serious challenge in personal and public
                health. Tens of millions of people each year suf-fer from depression and only a
                fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social
                media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individu-als. We first
                employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed
                with clinical de-pression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through
                their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we
                measure behavioral attributes re-lating to social engagement, emotion, language
                and linguis-tic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant med-ications.
                We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a sta-tistical classifier that
                provides estimates of the risk of de-pression, before the reported onset. We find
                that social me-dia contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of
                depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity,
                raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and
                medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe
                our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the
                onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of
                individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about
                their mental health.</p>},
